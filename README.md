## Logging in to update the bot


- Open a new private browser window, or new browser profile/session.
- Go to https://twitter.com and log into the indulgine twitter account
  - note: if you are working on a "development version" (previewing and testing changes), log into a temporary test twitter account instead.
- In a second tab, open https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/ . Click the button to authorize the Cheap Bots Done Quick to use the twitter account you've logged into.
- You can now edit the json code, preview changes, send out test tweet.
  - a good workflow is editing the .json file in your own code editor, then copy & pasting all from the editor into the Cheap Bots Done Quick input field any time you want to preview changes.
- When you are ready to commit your  changes to the bot, click the **Save** button at the bottom.
